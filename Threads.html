        <h3>Threads: A Close Friends Companion App by Meta Platforms</h3> 
      </div>

        <p>
            Threads is an online social media and social networking service that serves as a companion app to Instagram. It allows users to share various types of content, including photos, videos, and messages, exclusively with their chosen close friends. Threads is owned by Meta Platforms, a well-known American technology company that also owns Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.

Meta created Threads in response to the increasing popularity of close friends features on other social media platforms. Recognizing the demand for more private and intimate sharing experiences, Meta aimed to provide a dedicated platform for users to connect and share content with their close-knit friend groups.

Threads was officially released on July 6, 2023. However, it generated buzz prior to its release with a pre-launch appearance on the Apple App Store on July 3. This early preview allowed users to get a sneak peek of the app's features and functionality before its wider availability. The pre-launch phase also served as an opportunity for Meta to gather feedback and refine the app based on user responses.
