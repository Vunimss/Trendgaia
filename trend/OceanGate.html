          OceanGate is a privately owned company founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo SÃ¶hnlein. The company is based in Everett, Washington and is focused on ocean exploration and underwater research.

The company has a team of engineers, scientists, and ocean explorers who work together to provide access to the ocean for researchers, explorers, and filmmakers using their submersible technology.

In the early years, OceanGate acquired a submersible vessel named Antipodes. Later they built their own submersibles through which they have provided hundreds of clients access to the ocean. These submersibles are called Cyclops 1 and Titan.

Cyclops 1 is designed for shallow water diving and can reach a depth of up to 500 meters. It features underwater cameras and lights for observation and can hold up to five people. The submersible's 18-hour battery life makes it perfect for extended underwater missions.

Titan, on the other hand, is OceanGate's next-generation submersible and is designed for deeper dives. The submarine can reach depths of up to 4,000 meters and features a large, panoramic dome for increased visibility. Titan is also equipped with advanced scientific instruments.

The company has received several accolades for their work, including the Innovation Award in 2014 and 2015 for their 5-person carbon fiber submersible Cyclops 1, along with the Best Use of Technology Award from Ocean Business in 2015.

In 2023, there was an incident during OceanGate's expedition to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. The submersible named Titan went missing on June 18, 2023, during an attempted dive. Following this incident, the company conducted searches for the missing submersible using sonar and other technologies. However, at the time of writing this, the submersible had not been found.

Despite this setback, OceanGate continues to pioneer breakthroughs in underwater technologies that will enable humans to explore the ocean depths like never before. They're committed to providing access to the ocean and hope to inspire the next generation of ocean explorers.
